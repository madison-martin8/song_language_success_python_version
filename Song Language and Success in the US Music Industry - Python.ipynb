    "# Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to illustrate the relationship between the language of the lyrics of songs in popular music\n",
    "in the United States and the song’s success, using data from Spotify and radio plays. It was inspired by\n",
    "the recent rise in popularity of music sung in non-English languages in the US by artists like BTS, Bad\n",
    "Bunny, Maluma, Måneskin, and Blackpink.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Question** Does linguistic discrimination (discrimination on the basis of the manner of\n",
    "speaking or language being spoken) occur in the US popular music industry, as evidenced by\n",
    "discrepancies in either audience support or industry support?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sourcing the data \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to address the research question, I chose to source my songs from the pool of popular songs that\n",
    "have appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, as it has long been an industry standard. A total of 12\n",
    "consecutive months of chart data were collected (from January 2020 through January 2021), for a total of 5200\n",
    "songs. The charts and song data were collected directly from Billboard, and included the song’s rank (from\n",
    "1-100), title, artist, and week dating the chart. In order to measure the success or support of the songs on\n",
    "two levels, I also collected audience support data (Spotify streams) and industry support data (radio plays).\n",
    "The Spotify data was sourced directly from Spotify by week (to match the weekly Hot 100 chart), while the\n",
    "radio play data was sourced from Chartmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Language of Lyrics \n",
    "In order to assess the impact of lyric language on the support a song gets, I coded each song’s lyrics for\n",
    "language on a word-by-word basis. I started by identifying which songs were likely to have non-English lyrics using the cld3 package in R. However, the accuracy of language identification tools is poor, and is even less accurate\n",
    "on a singular word basis, so the rest of the coding for word language in each song’s lyrics was done by hand.\n",
    "For more information, see the appendix.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Note: these CSV files already contain the language coding variables along with streaming and radio play\n",
    "data, as all three sources of data were cleaned and combined previous to this project for brevity and clarity."

Roddy Ricch), \"Circles\" by Post Malone, and \"Say So\" by Doja Cat. Interestingly, \"The Box\" by Roddy Ricch was the most streamed song of the year, but was not in the top 10 most radio played songs - a pattern matched by other streaming hits in the rap genre like \"WHATS POPPIN\" by Jack Harlow and \"WAP\" by Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion. Alternatively, country songs like \"I Hope\" by Gabby Barrett and pop songs like \"Adore You\" by Harry Styles or \"Before You Go\" by Lewis Capaldi were radio hits but were not present in the top 10 streaming songs. \n",

This amount (12.8%) of explained variance is relatively low, which is to be expected in such a complex issue (how much radio play or audience support a song gets), especially considering this data set did not include any audio-based data which can influence popularity and success like genre, tempo, key, etc.The models from our last two analyses can be presented below: \n",

    "## Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "## Language and Industry Support\n",
    "\n",
    "When controlling for audience support or preference, as evidenced by Spotify streams per week, there was\n",
    "a bias against songs which included non-English language lyrics as seen in the number of radio plays\n",
    "per week. Specifically, the multiple linear regression analysis demonstrates that for this set of data, which\n",
    "spanned from January 2020 to January 2021, songs were assumed to have 19 fewer radio plays per week for every\n",
    "percent increase in non-English language included in the lyrics. This industry bias against radio streams becomes especially meaningful when considering that this data set only included songs which had reached a very high level of success in the industry, as being on the Billboard Hot 100, and that the average radio spins per week to be on the Top 500 Airplay Chartmetric chart was only 2,763.\n",
    "\n",
    "This disparity between the radio plays per week and audience support by streaming for songs with non-\n",
    "English lyrics clearly demonstrates the presence of an industry bias against non-English songs or artists,\n",
    "as the music industry is heavily involved in choosing what songs are played during radio programs. While\n",
    "radio stations do want to entice and keep listeners by playing music they are interested in, they also have\n",
    "to balance this desire with the drive to promote new music and support industry-backed artists which are\n",
    "being promoted to individual radio stations by music label promotion representatives (Knab, 2010). A\n",
    "string of lawsuits in the early 2000’s against these “pay-for-play” practices have not stopped the process of\n",
    "industry bias and corruption in radio, instead driving the industry to invent new and clever ways to influence\n",
    "radio towards any direction they prefer (Leight, 2019). This finding replicates earlier studies which have\n",
    "found industry bias based on performer attributes, such as race and gender, and expands upon the idea\n",
    "of a discriminatory music industry ecosystem by including linguistic discrimination (Lafrance, Worcester &\n",
    "Burns, 2011; Strong & Raine, 2018; Watson, 2019; Lafrance et al., 2017; Laybourn, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations and Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There were a few main limitations in this study. Firstly, the sample size of the data was limited by the lack\n",
    "of accurate programming solution to coding modern music lyrics on a singular word-based level, as many\n",
    "lyrics include complicated slang and code-switching which are not reliably marked by traditional spelling-\n",
    "check based methods (Barman et al., 2014). That, in addition to the limited access to high-quality data for\n",
    "the radio play data from Chartmetric, did not allow a large enough sample size to see a broader vision of\n",
    "trends in language composition of popular music. Secondly, the scope of the current study did not allow for\n",
    "inclusion of potential influences on music popularity other than audience support, which is most likely the\n",
    "reason the explained variance for the multiple linear regression model, although still statistically significant,\n",
    "is a small effect size (12.8%). This is understandable, as song characteristics (such as tempo, key, melodic\n",
    "content, and rhythmic patterns), artist characteristics (such as gender, race, age, overall popularity), and\n",
    "song success measures not included in this analysis (sales, YouTube streams, TikTok plays, etc.), along with\n",
    "the other features that have been shown in previous studies to impact song success are most likely producing\n",
    "much of the unexplained variance here (Cosimato et al., 2019; McAuslan & Waung 2018; Napier & Shameer\n",
    "2018; Nunes & Ordanini, 2014; Ordanini, Nunes & Nanni, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to address these questions and expand upon this study, future research could create a specific\n",
    "language identification function or dictionary that accurately reflects current popular music lyrical contents,\n",
    "and include many more possible sources of variation in song success as evidenced by audience and radio\n",
    "support in order to better assess the presence and strength of linguistic bias in the industry."
